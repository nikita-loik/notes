BioTech is a fast growing and extremely lucrative industry. It makes promises  and attracts investments unmatched by others. An investor often wants to understand either the market, or the product or both. Yet, it's a very complex industry to judge. With thousands of new products and technologies cropping up in this field some may come up in such different light, that it's almost impossible to notice them stemming from the same root.

Drug development may well be at the forefront of BioTech. For centuries, it was by a series of serendipities that we could find some chemicals with medicinal properties. Expectedly, with viruses jumping from species to species, bacteria developing resistance, and aging problems galore, investors would make a beeline to any technology offering a quicker more systematic approach to sieve through innumerable compounds. 

Some very advanced collections comprise up to 1 M compounds. Yet, it still take forever to test them one by one. Would not it be great to have a method which allows sorting even more chemicals with higher throughput? To find a company working with such technology would be a dream of an investor.
