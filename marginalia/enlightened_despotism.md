# Enlightened Despotism in a Modern Company

A naïve reader may rely on a platitude that there is time & place for everything & as far as enlightened despotism is concerned it is XVIII century Europe.

This must be a person, who worked in a tech team under a manager whose tech skills do not exceed occasionally applying the SUM function on a spreadsheet correctly. Nonetheless, they manage a team of people who do something technically demanding. Normally, they cannot follow the project the team is working on (let alone being able to solve technical issues the team may face — team is on their own in such cases), just keep track of some 'KPIs'. Naturally, a manager like this would need one tool to rule them all, because he is that kind of a guy. Unfortunately for the team, they are called project-management tools (if only those were called project-development or project-arrangement tools — anything implying there is work to be done rather than power to be exercised). Of course, the manager will pick a tool which he can open, a tool mostly useless & often painful for everyone on the team.

Would not it be nice if a manager had guts to admit that they don't understand the project well enough to select the tools to perform it? Just like that. You say you don't understand it & the team is free to chose the tools which suit the purpose. You know, like you'd do with a plumber who came to fix your toilet — you just care about time, money & the fact that shit doesn't overflow.

An experienced reader would say there must be place for enlightened despotism in the modern company.

This must be a person, who took part in one of those two-hour long corporate meeting with half a dozen highest-paid members of the company trying to decide what is the best name for their start-up. After two or three meetings like this company's top bananas engage the team, present them with a shortlist of their best options & ask their opinion. One or two more meetings down the line the big shots will finally arrive at a conclusions that 'Penguin' is the best name for the new publishing house or 'Apple' is just perfect for — yeah, you guessed it right — a computer company. A result which a five-year-old would produce in a fraction of a second. Investor's money well spent.

Would not it be nice if one of those bigwigs (the biggest, the oldest, or the hairiest one of them) just stood up & said 'As of today, our company is called X'? Just like that. No discussions. No debates. No long list of name candidates. No short-listed version of the long list.

The most perceptive reader would know the time & place to exercise despotic rule in modern company.
