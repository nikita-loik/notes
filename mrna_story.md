BioTech Market Case Study
Drug Discovery Patents 

1. Invest in BioTech
* Know your market — who are your competitors?<br/>
    Who is using the same technology?<br/>
    Why are they different? 
* Know your technology — what does technology actually do?

2. Zoom into technology 1.
Old approach Vs new approach.

3. Zoom into technology 2.
Exhaustively test the technology.

4. Zoom into technology 3.
How does the technology actually work?

5. Why does the market look so different?
What do companies promise?
Does it match the reality?

Ye shall know them by their fruit.

BioTech is a fast growing and extremely lucrative industry. It makes promises  and attracts investments unmatched by others. Yet, with dozens of new technologies and thousands of new products emerging daily, it's a very complex industry to judge.

Drug development may well be at the forefront of BioTech. For centuries, it was by a series of serendipities that we could find some chemicals with medicinal properties. To find a technology which allows sorting through chemicals with higher throughput would be a dream of an investor.

One such promising technology is mRNA display which can sort through collections of peptide with tremendous throughput. We managed to identify two companies (PeptiDream and Ra Pharmaceuticals) applying this technology to drug development.

|shares outstanding|125 716 748|47 328 875|

While both companies have comparable profile and are based on the same technology, their market capitalization differs by orders of magnitude. Here we try to analyse potential causes for such differences, with the assumption that there might be some missed business opportunities for Ra Pharmaceuticals.
