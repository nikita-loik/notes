## Graph Libraries
1. [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io) — has loads of very cool algorithms; however, depending on the tas, may be too slow for bigger graphs (over 1000 nodes)
2. [Graph-Tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) — much faster, but has way fewer graph algorithms.
3. [Networkit](https://networkit.github.io/) — claims to be the fastest.
4. [snap](https://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/) — developed and recommended by Stanford.

## Graph Databases
1. [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) — open-source
